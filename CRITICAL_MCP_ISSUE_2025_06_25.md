# 🚨 CRITICAL: Letta MCP Server v1.0.4 Not Working

## Issue Summary
The production Letta MCP server (v1.0.4) that we're preparing to release is NOT WORKING when configured in Claude. This is a blocker for the v1.0.4 release.

## What Happened
1. We successfully built and prepared v1.0.4 with documentation fixes
2. Attempted to dogfood our own production server at `/root/letta-mcp-server-enhanced/.venv/bin/letta-mcp-server`
3. The server fails to load in Claude (no tools available)
4. HuggingFace MCP also failed to load

## Previous Working Version
The older version at `/root/autodealai-letta/letta_mcp/letta_fastmcp_server.py` was working correctly.

## Critical Concerns
1. We made "enhancements" that may have broken core functionality
2. This blocks our v1.0.4 release to PyPI
3. We cannot make the repository public with a broken MCP server
4. Need to identify what changed between working and broken versions

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Compare the working version with v1.0.4 to identify breaking changes
2. Test the server outside of Claude to verify it starts correctly
3. Check for any dependency conflicts or missing requirements
4. Ensure backward compatibility was maintained
5. Fix the issue before deploying to PyPI

## Current MCP Configuration Status
Working servers (11 total):
- mem0 ✅
- github ✅
- zen ✅
- github-copilot-control ✅
- sequential-thinking ✅
- context7 ✅
- desktop-commander ✅
- playwright ✅
- codacy ✅
- omnisearch ✅
- zapier ✅

Failed servers:
- letta ❌ (our production v1.0.4)
- hf-mcp-server ❌
- serena ❌ (not added)

## Path Forward
DO NOT proceed with v1.0.4 release until this issue is resolved. The server must work flawlessly before making the repository public.
